# Flutter-Backend Alignment Fixes Applied

## 1. Booking Model Fixes âœ…
- Added `scheduledDate` getter as alias for `preferredDate`
- Updated JSON parsing to handle both field names
- Added backend compatibility in `toJson()` method

## 2. API Service Fixes âœ…
- Confirmed booking endpoints are correct (`/bookings` and `/bookings/my-bookings`)
- Added admin token management methods
- Fixed admin authentication token storage

## 3. Authentication Provider Fixes âœ…
- Added FlutterSecureStorage import and configuration
- Added admin authentication methods
- Fixed token storage for both user and admin

## 4. Validation Service âœ…
- Created comprehensive Flutter validation service
- Added validation for all form fields
- Aligned validation rules with backend expectations

## Backend Alignment Status:
- âœ… Service Types: water_purifier, ac_repair, refrigerator_repair
- âœ… Status Constants: pending, accepted, rejected, assigned, in_progress, completed, cancelled
- âœ… API Endpoints: All critical endpoints aligned
- âœ… Authentication: Both user and admin auth properly configured
- âœ… Model Fields: All required fields present and compatible

## Next Steps:
1. Import the new validation service in your forms:
   ```dart
   import '../services/flutter_validation_service.dart';
   ```

2. Use validation in your forms:
   ```dart
   TextFormField(
     validator: FlutterValidationService.validateEmail,
     // ... other properties
   )
   ```

3. Validate complete form data before API calls:
   ```dart
   final errors = FlutterValidationService.validateBookingData(
     serviceType: serviceType,
     customerName: name,
     // ... other fields
   );
   
   if (errors.isEmpty) {
     // Proceed with API call
   } else {
     // Show validation errors
   }
   ```

## Common Validation Errors Fixed:
- Empty required fields
- Invalid email formats
- Short passwords (< 6 characters)
- Invalid phone numbers (< 10 digits)
- Invalid service types
- Past dates for bookings
- Missing admin credentials

Your Flutter app is now properly aligned with the backend! ðŸŽ‰
